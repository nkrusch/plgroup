# Pearls Before Swine or Wine After Perl

Sometimes the best is from an outsider or the worst is from an insider. Expectations are meant to be subverted be it from without or within. For without the in you are without a doubt without a means to express an out. This award is for a paper that subverts insitutional boundaries and traditional ways people publish.


# The Hat-Trick

In sports, a hat-trick describes three positive feats in a single match. In PL, a hat-trick is a combination of three spectacular qualities in a single paper (main idea, writing, examples, visuals, evaluation, polished presentation, etc.). The winner of the hat-trick is a paper that best captures this quality.

# Who Woulda Thunk It

Imagine yourself at your desk, head in your hands after what seemed like an eternity of brainstorming and problem-solving, only to realize that the solution to your problem was incredibly simple. This award is for the paper that best captures this feeling, that is, proposes a surprisingly simple solution to a problem that seems utterly massive in scale.

# :construction:[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]:construction:

This award is for the paper that, however promising the contents are, feels unfinished and somewhat half-baked, as if the ideas and concepts within are still under construction.

# An Experience Like No Other

For a paper that _most feels like_ it could have come from Augusta University.

# Chicken scratch
Sometimes a great paper is ruined by a small detail. it's even worse when this is something that the reviewers could have caught, and especially so if bad choices introduce unnecessary complexity. worst of all though, is when bad mathematical notation makes an otherwise good paper impenetrable. this award goes to the authors of the paper with the worst notational choices.

# The Kindling for the Fire

## Option 1
The kindling used to light a fire may seem somewhat sacrificial, but the ability for the kindling to create a roaring flame out of the supplied firewood is a great and impressive feat. This dual-paper award goes to the papers that do just that, the two papers that work hand in hand, one boosting the other up to reach impressive conclusions that compares to a roaring flame.

## Option 2
As fuel, the kindling for a fire is very quickly burnt up to create a big, roaring fire, which utterly dwarfs the embers created within the initial kindling. This dual-paper award aims to capture that vision, being awarded to the papers that, while similar, one utterly dwarfs the other in scale, work done, and/or conclusions made.
