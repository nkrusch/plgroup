# Programming Languages Reading Group

<br/>

Augusta University Programming Languages (PL) Reading Group is a regular meeting to discuss exciting recent results in programming languages research.
The intent of the group is to learn about various ideas and generally broaden perspectives on PL research topics.

**We meet weekly on Fridays, 1-2 pm, at UH 122 conference room.**

We encourage everyone to join our reading group. Even if your primary focus is not PL, this is a chance to learn about various new topics that may become relevant to you later. 
It is also simply fun to hang out with us.

We randomly select papers from leading PL conferences: [POPL](https://popl23.sigplan.org/series/POPL), [PLDI](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/series/pldi), and [OOPSLA](https://2022.splashcon.org/series/splash).

**Discussion** We also have a `#plgroup` channel at AU CS Grad Students slack ([invitation link here](https://join.slack.com/t/aucsgradstudents/shared_invite/zt-1o2j9gvie-n2GttzW~KNJ5jdYpUxWkDw)).
