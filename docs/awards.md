#### Fall 2023 Award Categories

#### Get out of Jail Free 

> The room is cold. _How did I even end up here?_ you wonder. _This shouldn't have happened! This is completely ridiculous. How was I supposed to know licking doorknobs was outlawed in '78?_ It doesn't matter, you're here now and there's no way out. You reach down into your pockets hoping to find some left over gum, when you feel something you don't remember being there before. You pull the rectangular piece of cardboard out of your pocket and carefully inspect it. --_This solves all of my problems! They have to let me go now!_ This award is for the paper that completely solves the most niche problem you would never expect to have.

#### The Visual Storyteller

> Art is not what you see, but what you make others see. The best visuals are not just decorative illustrations, but add informing perspectives to the reading experience. This award recognizes the paper that best leverages the power of illustrations to enhance the author's story. 

#### Sisyphus Award
  
> For the intellectual odysseys that echo the eternal uphill climb, where understanding feels always a step away. This accolade is for those papers where the journey of learning is arduous yet, with each bear breakthrough leading only to more questions, never quite reaching the peak of comprehension. This is for the journey that leaves you feeling constantly on the cusp of breakthrough, only to realize the only thing that broke was you.

#### Through the Looking Glass Award
    
> Bestowed upon works that reveal a world beyond the mirror, where conventional views are turned upside down. This award celebrates papers that lead to unexpected realms of thought, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary and reshaping familiar landscapes into realms of wonder.

#### The Magician's Hat

> This award is reserved for papers that, like a magician's hat, manage to fit far more into their pages than seems physically possible. It honors those works where every new paragraph pulls another unexpected yet perfectly relevant concept out of thin air, leaving the reader both baffled and amused by the academic sleight of hand.

#### Judging a Book By Its Cover

> This award goes to the paper where, just by looking at the first page, we can determine how this paper is going to go, for better or for worse.

#### The Barbenheimer

> This award is for two papers so dramatically different from one another, yet somehow compliment each other in a unintended but convenient/funny way.
