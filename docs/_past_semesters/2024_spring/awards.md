#### Spring 2024 Award Categories

**The Hat-Trick**

In sports, a hat-trick describes three positive feats in a single match. In PL, a hat-trick is a combination of three spectacular qualities in a single paper (main idea, writing, examples, visuals, evaluation, polished presentation, etc.). The winner of the hat-trick is a paper that best captures this quality.

**Who Woulda Thunk It**

Imagine yourself at your desk, head in your hands after what seemed like an eternity of brainstorming and problem-solving, only to realize that the solution to your problem was incredibly simple. This award is for the paper that best captures this feeling, that is, proposes a surprisingly simple solution to a problem that seems utterly massive in scale.

**🚧[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]🚧**

This award is for the paper that, however promising the contents are, feels unfinished and somewhat half-baked, as if the ideas and concepts within are still under construction.

**An Experience Like No Other**

For a paper that _most feels like_ it could have come from Augusta University.

**Chicken Scratch**

Sometimes a great paper is ruined by a small detail. it's even worse when this is something that the reviewers could have caught, and especially so if bad choices introduce unnecessary complexity. worst of all though, is when bad mathematical notation makes an otherwise good paper impenetrable. this award goes to the paper with the worst notational choices.

**Homework Required**

This award is for a paper that is very understandable and readable at first glance, before suddenly blindsiding you with the necessity to read thousands of papers of background to understand anything.

**The "That's cool! But why tho?"**

This award is for the paper that wows you with its cleverness and innovation, presenting a concept so slick it slides right off the practical path. It's the paper that leaves you applauding the performance while quietly wondering, "That's genius, but what's it actually for?"

**Two's Complement**

Two complementary papers that form a third idea/paper from their two parts.
