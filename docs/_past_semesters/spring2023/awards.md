#### Award Categories

**The Great Teacher Inspires**

With dense figures, symbols, syntax, and semantics, PL research is revered for its traditions and high standards. This sometimes makes papers look intimidating to novice students.
This award recognizes a publication for presenting a rigorous technical contribution, while also including aspects of teaching to make the topic accessible to junior community members.

**The Rolex**

The famous Swiss watch is a symbol of quality, precision, durability and elegance.
Just like its namesake, this award recognizes a publication for its refinement and expertise in artisanship and careful perfection of details.

**The Cool Guy 😎**

Some people just pull you in with the way they are.
It does not necessarily matter what exactly they say,

This award however is awarded to those who went the extra mile and applied novel and interesting techniques to achieve this.
