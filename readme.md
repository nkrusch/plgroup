**This repository contains tooling for our programming languages reading group.**

Augusta University Programming Languages (PL) Reading Group is a regular meeting to discuss exciting recent results in programming languages research. 
The intent of the group is to learn about various ideas and generally broaden perspectives on PL research topics.
We select papers randomly from top programming languages conferences, with final selection made by ranked choice voting by reading group members.
We gather weekly in person to discuss the selected papers.
This repository contains a small website and tooling to assist in selecting papers to read.

## Guide for repository editing

This section describes to how to apply the most commonly expected changes.

**How to edit source conferences?**

The conference sources are in [`sources.txt`](data/sources.txt), one per line.
Change these sources, then run `npm run update` to regenerate a dataset of papers.
This process will take up to a few minutes, depending on the number of new papers.
The update is additive. To remove older entries, first delete `data/papers.json`.

**How to filter papers by specific keywords?**

"Stopwords" is a list of keywords where, if any of them appear in the paper title, that paper is not considered for selection.
Edit this list by changing [`stopwords.txt`](data/stopwords.txt).
Each line is considered a separate stop word, and paper is evaluated against each word in this list (case-insensitive match).

**How to change the website content?**

Edit files in [`docs`](docs) written in markdown.
The website theme is from [here](https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/the-au-forml-lab.github.io). 
You can override desired parts and customize the site following [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults).

**How to get a suggestion for next paper?**

Paper selection actions can be dispatched manually if needed.
Run the "random paper" action or "vote open" action, in [actions](https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/plgroup/actions), depending on the [configured workflow](#paper-selection-workflow-configuration). 
The option to dispatch an action is available based on repository permissions.
Running a paper-selection action will generate appropriate PRs with paper suggestions.

**How to change the paper selection schedule**

The paper-selection actions run on automated schedule.
To change the schedule, follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule).

## Semester maintenance

Light maintenance is needed between semesters/reading periods to boot and shutdown the automated actions.
  
### Start of semester

1. Update semester docs

    Set values for `SEM` and `YEAR` variables to the most recently concluded semester. 
    Then, run the command to archive the corresponding semester.
    It archives the appropriate files and initializes a new semester.
    
    ````shell
    SEM=fall && YEAR=2023 \
    && DOCS=docs/ && DATA=data/ \
    && OLD_DIR=$DOCS"_past_semesters/"$YEAR"_"$SEM \
    && mkdir -p $OLD_DIR \
    && cp $DOCS"index.md" $OLD_DIR"/index.md" \
    && mv $DOCS"papers.md" $OLD_DIR"/papers.md" \
    && [ ! -f $DOCS"awards.md" ] || mv $DOCS"awards.md" $OLD_DIR"/awards.md" \
    && echo -n '' > $DATA"/past.txt" \
    && echo -n '' > $DATA"/next.txt" \
    && touch $DOCS"papers.md"
    ````
    
    Edit `docs/index.md` front-matter to describe the current or upcoming semester.

2. Turn on paper selection workflow in _settings > secrets and variables > actions_:  
   - For reviewer approval, set `PAPER_CHOOSE_ON` value to `1`
   - For ranked choice voting, set `PAPER_VOTE_ON` value to `1`

### End of semester

1. Turn off paper selection workflows in _settings > secrets and variables > actions_:  
   Set `PAPER_CHOOSE_ON` and `PAPER_VOTE_ON` values to `0`.

## Initial setup & guidance for forking

The repository code is generic in the sense that, by changing the conference [`sources.txt`](data/sources.txt), it can be made to suggest any kinds of papers that have DOIs indexed by [Crossref](https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/plgroup/blob/main/src/config.js#L6).
Complete the following steps to activate the automated actions.

* **Enable workflow permissions** in _settings > actions > general_:
    - choose "Read and write permissions"
    - check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
* **Create environment secrets and variables**, with empty default values, in _settings > secrets and variables > actions_:
    - secrets: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and `AUTOMERGE_PAT` 
    - variables: `PAPER_CHOOSE_ON` and `PAPER_VOTE_ON` and `REVIEWERS`
* **[Configure a paper selection workflow](#paper-selection-workflow-configuration)** to enable automated paper suggestions.

## Paper selection workflow configuration

There are two available workflows: _ranked choice voting_ and _reviewer approval_.
One workflow should be enabled during a semester/reading period.

### Workflow I: ranked choice voting

This workflow generates four random paper suggestions.
Those suggestions are then posted to a Discord channel for voting by channel members.
A corresponding PR is generated for each paper suggestion.
The vote is concluded manually by merging the winning suggestion PR.
The remaining PRs will be closed/discarded automatically.
The relevant GitHub actions are "Vote open" and "Vote close".
This workflow requires Discord integration to conduct voting.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>
  <br/>In <i>settings > secrets and variables > actions (variables)</i>:<br/><br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Set <code>DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL</code> secret to direct to the intended discord channel.</li>
    <li>Set <code>PAPER_VOTE_ON</code> variable to <code>1</code> to enable voting.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

</p><strong>Ranked choice voting</strong> generates multiple paper suggestions and readers vote for a winner.
</td></tr></table>

### Workflow II: reviewer approval

This workflow chooses randomly one paper suggestion and designated reviewers must approve the PR.
Once a sufficient number of reviewers accept the suggestion, the PR is merged.
Closing a suggestion without approval automatically generates a new suggestion.
This process repeats until a satisfactory suggestion has been found.
The relevant GitHub actions is "Random paper".

    <ul>
        <li>Check "Require a pull request before merging".</li>
        <li>Set "Require approvals" count to the minimum number of reviewer required to approve paper suggestion.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Set <code>REVIEWERS</code> variable to a newline-separated string of GitHub usernames, for example <code>"user1 \n user2 \n user3"</code>. The users must have sufficient permissions to perform PR reviews.</li>
    <li>Set <code>PAPER_CHOOSE_ON</code> variable to <code>1</code> to enable automatic suggestions.</li>
    <li>Set <code>AUTOMERGE_PAT</code> secret to a personal access token of a user with repository write access, to enable auto-merging approved PRs. Permission scopes -- classic token: repo, or fine-grained token: pull requests write and contents write.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Set <code>DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL</code> secret to a Discord channel URL to enable notifications.</li>
  </ol>
